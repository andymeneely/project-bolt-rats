This is part of a series of game design vlogs from the maker of Squib. I'm working on a 9-card nanogame. I'm documenting what I did in Squib from the beginning. I'll be discussing game design stuff, Ruby stuff, Squib stuff, and just walking you through my design process.

Hopefully you will find this helpful if you are learning Squib, or just want some inspiration to design your own tabletop game.

Cheers!
