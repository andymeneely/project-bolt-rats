--Mechanics--
One card for resources: XP, HP, Attack, Creature HP.

Divide card into sections so you can have level maximums for what you can carry.
(Too much?)

Flip when you level up? What's on the flip side?

One card for tools:
Fabric helper
Metal helper (magnet): gain more metal each round
Oil fireball for attack: oil+fabric
Duct tape helper
Zeppelin: victory. Takes a lot of everything.
And resources
Metal
Fabric
Oil
Duct Tape

Maybe the resource card tracks raw resources and tools, and the character card tracks hit points and stuff.

Or use actual components or dice to track the amounts. Coins for metal. Cube for oils. Wink for duct tape. Another wink for fabric.

Maybe bartering is used for building tools! So you give resources and they give you an item.
