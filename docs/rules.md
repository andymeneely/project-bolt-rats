# Escape from Scrapland
A roguelike for one player.

_Gracie wandered too far into her uncle's scrap yard. Surrounded by strange and scary creatures, Gracie must barter, build, and battle her way to safety. Meanwhile The Crane watches her every move. Will she make it?_

## OBJECTIVE
You must build a Zeppelin, then defeat The Crane.
## COMPONENTS
*	7 Yellow 8mm cubes
*	6 Red 8mm cubes
* 1 Black 8mm cube
*	1 six-sided die
*	7 Creature cards
*	1 Resource Tracker card
*	1 Tool/Boss card
## SETUP
Take 3 yellow cubes and place them on 4 Metal, 3 Fabric, and 1 Oil on the Resource Tracker. Place the other yellow cubes aside. Place red cubes on 10 HP and 0 ATK, and the black cube on 7 Time Left. Place the Tool card next to the Resource Tracker. Shuffle the Creature cards with all Small Creatures face up.
## RESOURCES
Throughout the game, you will be managing several of your character's resources. You may voluntarily "ditch" any resources if needed at any time.
**Carry capacity** is represented by the number of yellow cubes you have.
**Metal**, **Fabric**, **Oil**, and **Duct tape** are all materials that need to be carried from one encounter to the next. Use yellow cubes to track how many materials you have. You are not limited to the number on your resource tracker; use additional yellow cubes to track more. _For example, to carry 12 Fabric you need 2 cubes._
**Hitpoints (HP)** represent your character's health. Use red cubes for this. Your max HP is 30. Use multiple cubes to represent the number if necessary.
**Attack (ATK)** represents additional attack power you have. Track with a red cube. Max ATK is 4.
**Time Left (RND)** represents the number of rounds you have after this one.
## TOOLS
Tools need yellow cubes to carry. You may carry as many Tools of the same type as you can, using one yellow cube each.
Some tools provide an ongoing power _(e.g. Bandages),_ while others are one-time usage _(e.g. Fireball)._ You may discard Tools at any time, with one exception (see "Build" below).
## GAMEPLAY
Each game is played in a series of Rounds. At the beginning of each Round, shuffle the Creature cards without looking at them. Place the first 5 Creature cards like so:

Each **Round** you will have exactly 3 Encounters. You must encounter the leftmost card, then you choose either the upper two cards or the lower two cards from left-to-right.

When you **Encounter a Creature**, you have up to three options: Barter, Build, or Battle. You must chose exactly one of these options.

To **Barter** with a Creature, you must exchange resources with them. The text on the card describes how this can be done for each creature.
*	When a colon(:) is used, the exchange may be made any number of times, with any items involved. _For example, 1:2 Metal:Fabric means you may give 1 Metal and get 2 Fabric, or vice versa, and do this as many times as you wish._
*	When the word "for" is used, then the exchange may only happen one time, and is not reversible. _For example, +1 Duct Tape for 3 Fabric means you give 3 Fabric and gain 1 Duct Tape, but NOT vice versa._
*	If "or" is used, then only one option is allowed. _For example, 3:2 Metal:Oil OR 2:1 Fabric:Oil means you may NOT exchange both Metal and Fabric in this Barter._

To **Build** a tool, the above language still applies, with the following additions:
*	You MAY use a Tool immediately upon building it.
*	You MAY NOT discard a Tool immediately after it has been built. (That would be insulting to the Creature!)

To **Battle** a Creature, set a red cube on the Creature HP to the card indicated. Battles are conducted in Turns where you Hit then the Creature Hits. Each turn begins with you rolling your die.
*	If the roll is a 2-5, then your Hit is your roll plus your ATK.
*	If the roll is a 6, then you get a Critical Hit and may roll again, adding your next roll to your Hit. Add ATK at the end of this sequence.
*	If the roll is a 1, then you Miss and attack for zero regardless of prior rolls and your ATK.

_For example, you have an ATK of 2 and roll a 3, so you hit for 5._
_For example, you have an ATK of 2 and roll a 1, you Miss and hit for 0._
_For example, you have an ATK of 2 and roll a 6. You decide to keep going. You roll another 6. You could keep going, but decide to stop. You hit for 6+6+2=14._
_For example, you have an ATK of 2 and roll a 6, then a 1, so you hit for 0 because it's a Miss._

After your die roll, subtract the Creature's ATK from your HP. Continue taking turns until either you or the Creature runs out of HP.
You may use any relevant Tools at any time during battle, _e.g. Fireball, Bandages._

Alternatively, some creatures allow you to instantly kill them in Battle if you have or use a certain tool. Note that some will say "Ditch" (e.g. the Bandages on Minor Ductwork), in which case you remove the cube from the tool card. Other tools merely require you to have a tool, but not ditch it (e.g. Bolt Rats and the Tote Bag)

If you have **won the battle**, then:
*	**Gain** any Metal, Fabric, or Oil that the creature was made of, and
*	If it was a  **Small Creature, flip it over** to the Big Creature
*	If it was a  **Big Creature, set the card aside** for the rest of the game.
After each Encounter, you must Carry what you can to the next Encounter. Any new items you gained must fit within the yellow cubes you have, otherwise ditch them. Note: Carry applies at the end of the Encounter, so you may gain more than what you can carry and then use, ditch, or reorganize it so that you can carry it.

_* For example, you are full on Carry with 8 Fabric. You Build a Tote Bag for 3 Fabric. You may instantly use that Tote Bag for +1 Carry, leaving you an extra cube._
_* For example, your Fabric is at 3 and you Build a Tote Bag, freeing up the yellow cube on your Fabric column. You carry that Tote Bag (after all, you might Encounter some Bolt Rats). In a later encounter, you need the Carry, so you use the Tote Bag ending with two freed up yellow cubes one for the +1 Carry and one that was freed up by using up the Tote Bag._

At the end of each Round, decrease the Time Left tracker by 1.
## GAME END
* If you run out of HP, you lose.
* If you go to deal your 5 cards at the beginning of a Round have fewer than 5, you lose.
* If you are at 0 RND at the end of your last encounter, you lose.
You may build the Zeppelin immediately once you have gained the requisite resources noted on the bottom of the Tools card. At that time, flip the Tool card over and battle The Crane. If you defeat The Crane, you win!

## EXTRA CHALLENGES
Looking for some extra challenges? Try these modified rules.
**CAMPAIGN**
Win 3 consecutive games. After each Crane victory, your Carry resets to 3, and your HP and any Resources or Tools you can Carry rolls over (you do not get additional Metal/Fabric/Oil for subsequent games). Reset ATK to 0. Time Left starts at 7 for the first game, then 5 for the second, then 4 for the third. Creatures reset to Small each time. _Somewhat Hard._
**NO PETS**
Start with the Socket Wrench Puppy flipped over. _Hard._
**ANALYSIS PARALYSIS**
Deal a third row of cards each round as another option, but you must gain 10 Metal, 8 Fabric, 4 Oil, and 4 Duct Tape for the Zeppelin. _Hard._
**PACKED LIGHT**
Start with 7 Metal, 6 Fabric, no Oil, and 2 Carry. _Harder._
**BEAST MODE**
Start with 3 Metal, 2 Fabric, 1 Oil, and The Crusher. The Crane has 10 extra HP. _Hardest._
