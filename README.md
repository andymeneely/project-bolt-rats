# Escape from Scrapland

_Gracie wandered too far into her uncle’s scrap yard. Surrounded by strange and scary creatures, Gracie must barter, build, and battle her way to safety. Meanwhile The Crane watches her every move. Will she make it?_

Escape from Scrapland is a solo roguelike nanogame with 9 cards, 1 die, and some cubes.

The process of making this game is being documented for users of [Squib](http://squib.rocks).
