# Escape from Scrapland

_Gracie wandered too far into her uncle’s scrap yard. Surrounded by strange and scary creatures, Gracie must barter, build, and battle her way to safety. Meanwhile The Crane watches her every move. Will she make it?_

Escape from Scrapland is a solo roguelike nanogame with 9 cards, 1 die, and some cubes.

The process of making this game is being documented for users of [Squib](http://squib.rocks).

# Get the latest

  * Print them out. Be sure to turn off page scaling
  * Cut them up
  * Put them in 2.5x3.5 sleeves. Pay close attention to what card should be on the back of what (small text in the corner).

Some videos are just me talking about my process, others are screen captures of walking through the entire prototyping process.

## v7.0 / 2017-09-01

* Balance changes! We're starting to zero in on a stable game here.
* Tape Dispensor is actually useful now!
* Oil Rag is easier to get, which makes Minor Ductwork a tad less ominous
* Ugly Sweater Ghost gives a nice defeat bonus (let's see more Sprocket Snake!)
* Ugly Sweater Ghost got a Barter nerf too
