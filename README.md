# Escape from Scrapland

_Gracie wandered too far into her uncleâ€™s scrap yard. Surrounded by strange and scary creatures, Gracie must barter, build, and battle her way to safety. Meanwhile The Crane watches her every move. Will she make it?_

Escape from Scrapland is a solo roguelike nanogame with 9 cards, 1 die, and some cubes.

The process of making this game is being documented for users of [Squib](http://squib.rocks).
